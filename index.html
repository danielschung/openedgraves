                <br><br>
                This website is to share my rig, and hopefully help others start using their MIDI Keyboards in the context of worship to God.
                <br><br>
                I believe that music can be an incredible tool to help others desire God more, and my hope is that God would raise up many people with genuine convictions to be used by Him in this way.</p>

                    <p id="passage"><strong>The Valley Of Dry Bones (Ezekiel 37)</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    1 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of the LORD and set me down in the middle of the valley; it was full of bones. 2 And he led me around among them, and behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley, and behold, they were very dry. 3 And he said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” And I answered, “O Lord GOD, you know.” 4 Then he said to me, “Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD. 5 Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live. 6 And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the LORD.”
                    <br><br>
                    10 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and  the breath came into them, and they lived and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army.
                    <br><br>
                    12 Therefore  prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will open your graves and raise you from your graves, O my people. And I will bring you into the land of Israel. 13 And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves, and raise you from your graves, O my people. 14 And I will put my Spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will do it, declares the LORD.</p>

                    <p id="testimony">Our graves have been opened. We are the resurrected dry bones, hopelessly dry, but redeemed to live and to be used to help bring others to life as well. My vision is that God would breathe life into his people, opening the graves of the dead and raising up those that have been dry to become an exceedingly great army that has experienced the wellspring of life and goes forth to proclaim the Glory of the Lord Jesus Christ to the ends of the Earth.</p>

                <p>I’ve been able to connect with a few people who were interested in using my set, so I decided to give my entire set to those interested in worship for free. If you are interesting in downloading my Ableton Live 9 Set, click the link below</p>
                
                <a href="/2176718445cfcmididownloadlink2017/"><p id="download">Click to download</p></a>
                
                <p>If you have questions, send me an email at <a href="mailto:dchunkz@gmail.com">dchunkz@gmail.com.</a> I’d love to connect with anyone interested in using MIDI in worship settings.</p>

                <p id="note">Note: In order for you to use the set you must own an actual copy of Ableton Live 9. But once you own your own copy of the software, you will be able to use the set exactly how I use it today for free. All the sounds in this set are created fully with Ableton Live without any external synths that require additional pay.</p>
